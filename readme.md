<p align="center">A financial project, created by the Rocketseat team.</p>

### About
<p>This project is without a doubt the starting point of my studies and my career. Recently on this date of this commit the Rocketseat team created a "Maratona Discover", taught by dear "Mayk Brito" it was sensational to participate! The application brings the theme of finance, entries, exits and the total obtained from a formula. :tada:</p>

### Languages
<p>For this project, languages ​​were used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

### Notes
<p>The application saves the progress in the browser (LocalStorage), receives inputs with description and date, as well as outputs with description and date and finally makes a calculation and returns the total. The only difference in the code that Maykão made with mine, is that I deactivated the (autocomplete) of the entries and made some small changes in the structures of the three files. :computer:</p>

### Additional
<p>Project done on a Chromebook.</p>
